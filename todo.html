            Prologue

      In this section you will be required to write a code, this is the part that we will be able to see who you are. 

      You can write it in any IDE / notepad , also web search is permitted 

      You will need to upload the code to code repository ( GITHUB/bitbucket ... ) and supply link to download.

      In this part you will work with the following API https://swapi.co/

       

      What you need to do ?

      Fetch all persons from https://swapi.co/ and render it into grid with pagination.
      For each person it is necessary to create a detailed view with the received information about the person (the table will be enough).
       

      Optional steps:

      Need to create CLI-script to fetch information from https://swapi.co/about all persons and store this information to the database(if information presents in database - persons grid should use database)
      Need to add possibility to edit information from detailed view of person or deleting person from directly from the persons grid.
      Add users to created system and allow edit or delete operations only for authorized users.
       

      Imoprtant notes 

      Perform as many optional steps as you can. The more optional steps will be performed the bigger the advantage.
      The task can be performed using any technology/package/library of the PHP(except SWAPI libs) and the front-end.
      Laravel 5 and Angular 2+ will be a big advantage.
       

      Please make sure :

      Include the link to code (on GitHub for example) in the answer bellow 

       Add comments to code - It will help us to understand your way of thinking 

       

      Good luck and see you soon !
